As I get this site up and running, I thought it would be a good idea to
discuss some of the topics I plan to cover in the future. These mostly
relate to software I've developed and to software engineering and
computer science experiences I've had, but I may branch out into other
topics from time to time.

### My Linux Experience: The Power of User-Centric Software
I've daily-driven Arch Linux on my laptop since 2021. Over two years of use
and many hours of troubleshooting and research have taught me the power of the Unix command
line and the value of an in-depth understanding of errors. I plan to discuss
my switch, my new workflows, and the advantages of Linux for the modern
developer and student.

### How I Implemented Version Control with Git for My Team
Back in high school, I had the valuable opportunity to work on production code
alongside several other students and our instructor, a semi-retired industry
professional. When the COVID-19 pandemic forced us to use a hybrid work model
and made the workflow we inherited untenable, I trained the team on how to
use Git and played a vital role in migrating our codebase and workflow to a
new, hybrid-friendly model that also had all the advantages of version control
with Git. This experience conveyed some valuable lessons, which I hope to
discuss in the post.

### Even My Keyboard is Open-Source: A Charybdis Build Log
I currently use an ergonomic, open-source keyboard called the Charybdis. I built
this keyboard myself, which was a rather harrowing experience. I plan to discuss
the challenges I faced while constructing the keyboard and the key layout I
designed for it.

### StageViewer: A Visualization Tool for Steve from Minecraft in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate
An ongoing project that will be publicly available soon is a tool a friend
requested. It's a Svelte application running locally with Tauri that can
visualize structures built by [Steve from Minecraft in Super Smash Brothers
Ultimate](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Steve_(SSBU)), and will be able to save
and load them for sharing and storage purposes. I plan to discuss my experience
with Svelte and Tauri, and the reasoning behind some of the decisions I made in
the project, and link to a usable release version.

Hopefully some of these ideas have piqued your interest, but, if not, I will
eventually be covering other topics as well.
